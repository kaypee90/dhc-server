# Django Health Check Monitoring Server

The Django Health Check Monitoring Server is a Go application designed to consume data captured by the Django Health Check Monitoring library via a RESTful API. It formats this data and exposes it in an OpenTelemetry-compatible format via another RESTful API.

## Features

- **Data Consumption**: The server consumes data captured by the Django Health Check Monitoring library, allowing you to monitor the health of your Django application.

- **Data Formatting**: It formats the consumed data to ensure compatibility with OpenTelemetry standards, making it easier to integrate with existing monitoring and observability tools.

- **RESTful API**: The server exposes the formatted data via a RESTful API, providing a convenient way to access and analyze health check data.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**: Run the server application using the provided command-line interface.

2. **Configure Integration**: Configure the server to consume data from the Django Health Check Monitoring library and expose it via the RESTful API.

3. **Access Formatted Data**: Access the formatted health check data via the exposed RESTful API endpoints.
